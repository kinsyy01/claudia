    <h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
    <h2>Claudia Sandoval</h2>
    <h3>For this homework, I was interested in analyzing potential contamination risk to surface and groundwater supplies in North Carolina.</h3>
    <h1>Where is water contamination potential located and which communities are most at risk?</h1>
    <h2>Map 1: Determining the location of landfills and concentration of UST's</h2>

    <h3>I began my analysis by obtaining shapefiles of permitted landfills and UST incidents in North Carolina. I overlaid this data on NC County lines and major river basins. I used the 'Clip' tool to clean up the edges of the map. I was interested in establishing spatial patterns and distributions of UST incident and landfills. </h3>
    <h2>Map 2: Determining which landfills are active and produce municipal solid waste (MSW) as a majority of waste production, with 10 mi buffer</h2>

    <h3>For this next map, I also included surface water supply watersheds to analyze risk for contamination. I chose to filter the landfills by sites that produced majority MSW since this type of waste is highly prone to leaks through leachate and compaction of geologic components over time. Hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted by MSW landfills include, but are not limited to, vinyl chloride, ethyl benzene, toluene, and benzene. "Each of the HAP emitted from MSW landfills can cause adverse health effects provided sufficient exposure." (EPA)</h3>
    <h2>Map 3: Determining which surface water supplies are most at risk, with UST incident and MSW Landfill overlay</h2>

    <h3>This map reflects the portion of surface water supplies in NC that fall within a 10 mile buffer of MSW landfills. I thought it would be interesting to analyze the proximity of surface supplies since surface water is often not associated with contamination by landfill and UST leaks. "Leaking underground storage tanks (USTs) are a significant source of environmental contamination and may pose the following threats to human health and safety: fire and explosion; inhalation of dangerous vapors; contamination of soil and groundwater; contamination of drinking water; and contamination of streams, rivers, and lakes." (EPA)</h3>
