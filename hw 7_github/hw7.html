    <h3>This map shows known contanimated sites in NJ against the population below poverty level. According to NJ.gov, "Known Contaminated Sites List (KCSNJ) for New Jersey are those sites and properties within the state where contamination of soil or ground water has been confirmed at levels equal to or greater than applicable standards. This list of Known Contaminated Sites may include sites where remediation is either currently under way, required but not yet initiated or has been completed."</h3>
